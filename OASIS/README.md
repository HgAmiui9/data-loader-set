# OASIS-1
## Summary
This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the included subjects over the age of 60 have been clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Additionally, a reliability data set is included containing 20 nondemented subjects imaged on a subsequent visit within 90 days of their initial session.

For analysis, AD patients were upsampled to balance the dataset.

### CDR 
CDR means Clinical Dementia Rating, which is the label of AD.
>0   = absent
0.5 = questionable
1   = present, but mild
2   = moderate
3   = severe
4   = profound
5   = terminal

0 -> 0, false; [0.5,1]->1, true
| Label | Number |
| --- | --- |
| NAD | 135 |
| AD | 98 (70,28)|
| Unknow | 203 |
| Amount | 436 |

### Data divide
In supervised classification,  only select CDR not NaN data. Then devide then.
>training ---> 80%
test ---> 20%
